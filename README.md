# WeatherDashboard

## Hello there, thanks for checking out this repository! Below you will find details of this weather dashboard.

- My motivation for this was to make a weather dashboard that showed the current weather, and even the forecast for the next 5 days.

- I built this dashboard because I wanted a good way to check the weather out with a forecast all in one place. 

## Installation

## Usage 
* A. Click on empty form above the city names on the left.

* D. Congrats! On the screen it will display a city with current weather, and a forecast of that city. 
* E. Your past searches will display on the left, click again on those cities to display forecast and weather of that city again.
